Never ever modify files in src/app/(payload) directory
When i ask you something just to discuss dont start changing things and all. Discuss first tell me your plan ask if i would like the changes.
Always tell me whats your plan what you are going to do then take my consent and then do it.
Always focus on my command, dont skimm read.
